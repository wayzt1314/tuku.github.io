### About this repo
This is the repository of Chevereto Free, forked from Chevereto 3.X. Chevereto Free has the same look and feel of our [paid version](https://chevereto.com), but it packs only the most essential features. It is Open Source software licensed under the AGPLv3 license.

### Free vs Paid Chevereto
The paid version includes all features, it gets frequent updates, and it is always up to six months ahead of the free edition. The table below shows the distinctions between both versions.
